## Introduction
My undergraduate work (awarded Outstanding Final Design), a K8s-based edge cloud system consisting of (i) a front-end based on Rancher and Echarts visualisation with lots of interesting interactive animations, and (ii) multiple back-ends supported by classical, intelligent scheduling algorithms.
